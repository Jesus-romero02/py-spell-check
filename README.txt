Welcome to my Python-created Spell Checker!!

The program is pretty simple. When running it, an interface will pop up, 
containing a text box and a button. There is a label on top of the text box that indicates you should enter 
whatever text you want spell checked. Once you are done entering the text, simply click on the "Check my
words!!" button below the text box. Once the buton is clicked, the program will go through its code and 
will spit all the important information in the command prompt. You will be returned a sentence outlining 
what word it is the program detemined was written incorrect, and below it, you will be returened various different
suggestions to fix the spelling error. That's it, have fun!
